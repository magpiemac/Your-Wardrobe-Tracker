Overview

Your Wardrobe Tracker with JavaScript API allows you to track your wardrobe items and their accompanying descriptions. Your wardrobe items can be placed into multiple capsules that you also create and track.
Logging In or Registering
On the main page, you must sign up or log in to add wardrobe items and capsules. You may also log in using Facebook. After you have logged in, you will be directed to your main wardrobe items user page which will display all your existing wardrobe items and allow you to create, edit or delete those wardrobe items.

New Capsule

You can add a capsule without adding a wardrobe item. Capsule names must be unique.

Installation

To use the application locally, fork and clone the repo. Then run bundle install from the directory. Next run rake db:migrate to load the databases. Then, run rails s and navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser.
